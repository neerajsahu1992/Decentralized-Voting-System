# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based transparent and secure voting platform built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. This system eliminates the need for traditional centralized voting authorities by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure vote immutability, transparency, and verifiability.

The platform allows administrators to create voting sessions, register eligible voters, and manage candidates, while providing voters with a secure and anonymous way to cast their votes. All voting data is stored on the blockchain, making it publicly auditable and tamper-proof.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize democratic processes by creating a trustless, transparent, and accessible voting system that can be used for various scenarios including:

- **Government Elections**: Municipal, state, and national level voting
- **Corporate Governance**: Shareholder voting and board elections  
- **Community Decisions**: HOA votes, student council elections
- **DAO Governance**: Decentralized organization decision making
- **Survey and Polling**: Transparent opinion collection

We aim to increase voter confidence, reduce election costs, eliminate fraud, and make voting accessible to everyone regardless of their physical location.

## Key Features
